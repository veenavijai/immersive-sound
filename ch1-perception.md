# Perception of Spatial Sound

Immersive sound: The common meaning of immersion in audio and acoustics refers to the psychological sensation of being surrounded by specific sound sources as well as ambient sound.

Auditory physiology: The different functions performed by the auditory system are classically categorized as peripheral auditory processing and central auditory processing.

### Peripheral Auditory Processing

Summary: The peripheral auditory system includes processing stages from the outer ear to the cochlear nerve. Transformation of sound in this stage can be compared to me a Fourier analysis of the incoming sound waves. Sound enters the ear as pressure waves, whose pressure is selectively amplified by the external and middle ear and then transmitted to the fluid-filled cochlea in the inner ear.

#### External Ear

Comprises the pinna and canal. 

(1) It gathers the pressure waves and focuses them on the eardrum at the end of the canal. The canal selectively  boosts sound pressures, which makes humans especially sensitive to frequencies in the range of 2â€“5 kHz - probably directly related to speech perception.

(2) A second important function of the pinnae is to selectively filter sound frequencies in order to provide cues about the elevation of a sound source: up/down and front/back angles.
